# EyeBlinkDetector
This is an app that detects eye blinks. I have used dlib's "Histogram of Oriented Gradients + Linear SVM" based method for object detection. But there is still some problems. Sometimes app doesn't detect the blinks but sometimes it detects blinks. I need to play around with threshold value and EAR.
